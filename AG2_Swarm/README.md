**AI Project: Agentic Investment Research Swarm (AG2)**

Building AI powered agents that think like an analyst, straight from Google Colab!

In this project, I used AG2 (formerly AutoGen) to create a swarm of intelligent agents that collaborate to perform real-time investment research. Each agent plays a specialized role â€” gathering data, evaluating sentiment, estimating valuation, and more, all orchestrated automatically using GPT-4o.

Agents in Action:
ðŸ”¹ Financials Agent â€“ Extracts key metrics like revenue growth & P/E ratios
ðŸ”¹ Sentiment Agent â€“ Analyzes live headlines via Yahoo Finance
ðŸ”¹ Valuation Agent â€“ Assesses fair value using real data
ðŸ”¹ Risk Agent â€“ Flags red flags like volatility & sector risks
ðŸ”¹ Summary Agent â€“ Compiles a full investment brief
ðŸ”¹ Reporting Agent â€“ Generates visual stock charts right inside the notebook

Built fully in Google Colab for easy replication. Just plug in your API key and start analyzing. 
The functions in this notebook  are simplified examples meant to illustrate how each agent interacts with external data. In real world, these functions would be significantly more complex

Got other use cases for multi-agent AI swarms? Letâ€™s connect and brainstorm!
