\# Shadow Investment Committee (Shadow IC)



A \*\*multi-agent debate system\*\* that simulates an Investment Committee review of an investment memo \*\*before\*\* it reaches a real committee.



The goal is to surface \*\*blind spots, assumptions, and risks early\*\*, and generate a \*\*clear challenge checklist\*\* for deal teams.



Designed for \*\*private credit, private equity, hedge funds, and investment research\*\*.

\## What It Does



Given an investment memo, Shadow IC:



\* Runs a \*\*multi-agent IC debate\*\*

\* Challenges the memo from different professional roles

\* Produces a \*\*structured checklist of IC-style questions\*\*

\* Helps teams prepare before real decision meetings

\## Shadow IC Agents



\* \*\*Portfolio Manager\*\* – risk/return, portfolio fit

\* \*\*Credit Risk Officer\*\* – leverage, liquidity, downside

\* \*\*Documentation Counsel\*\* – covenants, leakage, protections

\* \*\*Macro \& Sector Analyst\*\* – cycles, rates, sector risk



Agents read the same memo, see each other’s comments, and explicitly agree or disagree.

\## Why Multi-Agent Debate?



Most investment risk comes from \*\*interpretation, not missing data\*\*.

Multi-agent debate introduces structured disagreement and reduces surprises in real IC meetings.
