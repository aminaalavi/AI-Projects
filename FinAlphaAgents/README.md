\#AI Project: Debating Alpha Agents â€” Investment Portfolio Construction (AG2)



Building AI-powered agents that debate like a team of analystsâ€”all in Google Colab.



I used AG2 (formerly AutoGen) to build specialized agents that collaborate and then debate before producing a BUY/SELL/HOLD decision. Tools fetch facts first; the debate runs on those facts for stability and reproducibility.



Agents in Action

ðŸ”¹ Valuation Agent â€” annualized return \& volatility from historical prices

ðŸ”¹ Sentiment Agent â€” tone \& risks from news + SEC filings

ðŸ”¹ Fundamental Agent â€” targeted 10-K/10-Q snippets via a tiny RAG

ðŸ”¹ Coordinator â€” synthesizes a final decision as clean JSON



Whatâ€™s special

â€¢ Facts are gathered outside the debate â†’ agents argue from the same ground truth

â€¢ Tools are paused during the debate â†’ fewer hallucinated calls

â€¢ Outputs are parseable JSON â†’ easy to plug into downstream notebooks

â€¢ Fully reproducible in Colabâ€”add your API key and run
