### **🚀 AI Project: CaptainAgent AG2**  

Integrating **AI agents** into your code is easier than you think!  

In this example, I’ve used **AG2’s (formerly AutoGen) CaptainAgent** to automatically spin up and orchestrate multiple specialized agents for efficient task execution, powered by **GPT-4o-mini**. To keep it simple and easy to modify, I’ve set it up in **Google Colab**—just add your **OpenAI API key** (stored securely in Colab secrets), and you're good to go!  

### **🛠️ Agents in Action:**  
🔹 **Economics Expert** – Analyzes financial trends  
🔹 **AI Strategy Expert** – Provides insights on AI adoption  
🔹 **Industry Applications Expert** – Identifies real-world AI use cases  
🔹 **Data Analysis Expert** – Extracts insights from complex datasets  
🔹 **Python Expert** – Handles implementation and debugging
